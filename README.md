# Numerical Methods Papers - Year 2 Data Science @ Warsaw University of Technology

## Description

This repository houses my academic endeavors and projects on numerical methods and analysis, compiled during the second year of my Data Science curriculum at the Warsaw University of Technology.

1. **Solving Systems of Linear Equations \(Ax = b\), where \(A\) is a Pentadiagonal Matrix, using the Gauss-Seidel Method**: This paper ventures into the iterative Gauss-Seidel method tailored for linear equations resolution. It underscores the method's precision and efficiency, especially pertinent to pentadiagonal matrices, frequently occurring across various scientific and engineering calculations.

2. **Convergence of the Interpolation Process for Selected Mathematical Functions**: This manuscript scrutinizes the convergence characteristics inherent to polynomial interpolation processes. By evaluating the interpolation behavior of distinct functions and the node selection's influence on convergence speed, it furnishes insights into polynomial interpolation's practical uses and its constraints.

These documents synergize theoretical analysis with practical simulations, illustrating the pivotal role of numerical methods in untangling complex mathematical conundrums, thus underscoring their significance in Data Science's domain.
